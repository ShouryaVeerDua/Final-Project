# Final-Project
This is my Azure Submission Project for FRT Intern

Project Description:
A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject. I deployed this website over Azure Platform as the host, under the project of my FRT internship.

It was a very simple deployment over Static Web Apps on Azure, thus no coding was needed as task was accomplished through portal itself.

I have completed this task on my Azure portal provided to me from my college, with student benefits. The id used is shourya.dua-coend@bvp.edu.in .
