# Final-Project
This is my Azure Submission Project for FRT Intern

Project Description:
A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject. I deployed this website over Azure Platform as the host, under the project of my FRT internship.
